* Countries I would like to recommend to visit. 

|Name Of Country|Reason to visit|Days to spend|
|--|--|--|
|Spain|A number of independent kingdoms united in 1492 to form the Kingdom of Spain, a cultural patchwork that continues to shape the modern nation’s dynamic identity. Spain comprises much of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with Portugal on the southwestern edge of Europe. It also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and two enclaves in North Africa.|19 DAYS|
|Australia |The Commonwealth of Australia occupies the Australian continent. The country also includes some islands, most notably Tasmania. Indigenous people occupied the land for at least 40,000 years before the first British settlements of the 18th century.|17 Days|
| France|The influence France has on the world, both in the past and today, is difficult to overstate. Located in Western Europe, France is one of the world’s oldest countries, and its reach extends around the globe through science, politics, economics and perhaps above all, culture.|20 Dys|
|Switzerland|Switzerland, officially called the Swiss Confederation, is a small country in Central Europe made up of 16,000 square miles of glacier-carved Alps, lakes and valleys. It’s one of the world’s wealthiest countries, and has been well-known for centuries for its neutrality.|10 Dys|

# SVG Patterns
> This is a collection of simple SVG shapes used as patterns. This list may grow over time but the idea is less to have a comprehensive collection than it is to have the syntax handy as a starting point for creating new and exciting patterns.
